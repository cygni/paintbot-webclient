        Feel free to hack your own Paint Bot and train it in the Training room. From time to time we hold tournaments

        Here are the default rules:
        <ul>
          <li>Each client must respond within 250ms</li>
          <li>1 point per tile owned</li>
          <li>5 points per stun caused (through power-ups)</li>
          <li>8-10 ticks before stun is over</li>
          <li>3 ticks of invulnerability after being stunned</li>
          <li>30 obstacles</li>
          <li>Bots may carry one power-up at a time</li>
          <li>The power-up may be used at any point</li>
          <li>Using the power-up fills the tiles within Manhattan distance 4 from your bot</li>
          <li>Any other bots within the area where a power-up is used will be stunned</li>
          <li>Moving into a hole, the edge of the map or another bot will stun you</li>
          <li>The bot with the most tiles in the end wins</li>
        </ul>
